FrSky Pixel OSD Python SDK
==========================

This Python SDK can be used to quickly prototype drawing code that
interacts with the OSD.

The `frkskyosd.py` file can also be directly invoked as a Python
program for performing several tasks like font uploading and
firmware updates. It can also connect to both real devices (passing
the path to the port) or to the OSD simulator (passing host:port).
Invoke it without any arguments to see its help.

SDK functions are named after their remote API functions and are
roughly equivalent. Please, see the main documentation for an
explanation of what each function does.
